<h2>Some personal Info:</h2>
<p>My name is Mohammed (it's mentioned in the title btw). I was born in 2003 
    (Which means I'm 20 years old, do the math) in Al-Riyadh city, but I'm originally from 
    Al-Kharj city. I was raised in Al-Riyadh. And now, I live in al-Dhahran to pursuit my 
    educational.

<h2>Education:</h2>
<p>I started my learning journey at Al-Manarat School. I stayed there till I graduated from high school. 
    I don't remember learning anything valuable from school. However, I had a lot of fun during my school years and made many friends I'm grateful for.
    And then, I finished school, and it was time to look for a university to continue my education.
    I applied to many universities in Saudi Arabia(I never thought of studying abroad). After thinking and considering my options, I chose to go to King Fahd University. Now, I'm a Computer Science student at King Fahd University in my junior year.</p>
